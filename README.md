# Famous Painting Artist Recognition

## Overview

**Famous Painting Artist Recognition** is a simple tool developed as part of a course assignment. It utilizes an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify the artist of a given painting based on its image.

> ðŸ“˜ This project was created as part of an academic assignment to explore the application of CNNs in image classification.

## Features

- **Image Input**  
  Accepts images of paintings as input for analysis.

- **Feature Extraction**  
  Employs multiple convolutional and pooling layers to accurately extract features from the input images.

- **Artist Identification**  
  Classifies the extracted features to determine the specific artist who created the painting.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
